Learning mongodb and mongoose.  

The training was fun because it showed the differences between updating data in a server versus updating data in a server's database. The important methods were .find(), .findOne(), and .findOneAndRemove().  
  
Remember to access the database using db.*Model*

## Base Challenges - Build an App using mongoDB and mongoose

We're going to take this app piece by piece over the course of the day and build it up.

At first it's going to be a list of **books**.  Later we'll add in **authors** and embed **character** data in each book.

[Sprint 1 - Mongoose](docs/sprint1.md)

Let's create an **author** model that gets referenced in the **book** model!

[Sprint 2 - Reference & Populate](docs/sprint2.md)

Let's create a **character** model that gets embedded in the **book** model!

[Sprint 3 - Embedded](docs/sprint3.md)
